Keep in mind that if you're using a version of node we don't support that
could also be an issue. Check our package.json file "engines" config for the
supported version.

Also keep in mind that if you're using a version of react we don't support
that could be an issue. Check our package.json file "peerDependencies" config
for the supported version.
